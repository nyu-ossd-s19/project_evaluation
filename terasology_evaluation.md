## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__ https://terasology.org/


__What is the purpose of the project:__


__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__ While the contribution instructions were not on the website itself, it was very easy to navigate to them. If you go to their GitHub, there is a developer's section that links to their wiki. 

__Contributing instructions:__ In their wiki, there is a lot of information on how to set up a development workspace, what to contribute on, and more. However, they don't have specifics on what format they want contributions to be in. As long as you have Java 8 SDK running with Gradle, you can follow the wiki instructions to get started immediately. They have forums for feature suggestions, but no specific templates for pull requests or issue reports.

- __how active is the discussion on the issues:__ 

Very active 

    - __example of a lot of good discussion:__ 

This could be an option if #12774 will be solved by removing empty bins in every case. I'm not sure if this should be optional behaviour or not. I stumbled upon some strange edge cases when trying to do that similar to #13165, but better discuss it there.

I've tested this on QuantileTransformer with the toy data from above. Resulting quantiles_ are indeed monotonic with n_quantiles=11, but the transform method seems to handle it well anyway and gives the expected result.
    
    - __example of an issue that does not have much discussion:__

Faster PolynomialFeatures https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/13173
